    <h1>Potatoes and Peppers</h1>
    <p>This dish is a classic: Easy, filling, and very tasty! I served it as a side with grilled shrimp and corn on the cob and it was a huge hit. Would also be good at breakfast instead of hash browns. </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>â…“ cup olive oil </li>
        <li>6 potatoes, sliced </li>
        <li>2 large red bell peppers, sliced into rings </li>
        <li>1 large sweet onion, peeled and chopped </li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Fry the potatoes for 5 minutes, then add the peppers and onions. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for at least 15 minutes, turning potatoes frequently, or until potatoes start to look mushy.</li>
